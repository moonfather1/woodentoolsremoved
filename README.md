## Wooden tools are dumb
#### Minecraft mod that changes early game (obtaining wood and stone)


You are done cringing at wooden pickaxe and punching tree for logs. 

This mod provides a simple but believeable way to get logs - a simple flint hatchet. 

After that mod offers a rather challenging way to obtain first cobblestone blocks. It might take a day or two in-game. During that time, you are limited to pre-stone materials. Alternatively there is a simple way to obtain stone (if you set it so in config file); boring and without challenge, but at least more sensible than wooden pickaxe.
