This is ***MoonFather's limited license***.

It will list rights and permissions in readable terms, divided by your use case.

### Using parts of code in your mods for Java Edition

Allowed and encouraged.
Consider the code under MIT license for that purpose.

### Using text resources (models, blockstates, recipes, etc.) for your Java Edition mod

Allowed and encouraged.

### Using textures

Depends on its origins, so you'd have to ask. Or just take a simple "no" for an answer.

Some textures are gpl/mit/etc. and I'll point you to original source. You can have those.
Some are my own work (you likely don't want those), I likely won't mind you using them.
Some, I have paid for, or obtained via special agreements - I am probably not okay with anyone using those.

Sorry.

### Porting to Bedrock Edition

No. Big fat no.
I will do it eventually.

### Mod distribution

Generally not allowed.

I don't mind distribution for legitimate reasons (Modrinth and CurseForge unavailable in your part of the world or something like that), but I insist on obvious conditions: jar file is to be unmodified, supported versions must not be misrepresented, origin (me) must be clear and include proper links. These three conditions exclude mod reposting sites.
